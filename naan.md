###Ingredients

 * 2 tsp yeast
 * 1 tsp sugar
 * 1/2 cup water
 * 2 1/2 - 3 cups flour
 * 1/2 tsp salt
 * 1/4 cup vegetable oil
 * 1/3 cup greek yogurt
 * 1 large egg
 * Non-stick cooking spray
 
###Dough

In a small bowl combine yeast, sugar, & water. Stir and let sit until frothy.

Stir in oil, yogurt, & egg until combined.

In a medium bowl combine 1 cup flour, & salt.

Add the wet ingredients to flour/salt mixture and stir to combine.

Continue adding flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until you can no longer stir with a spoon *(about 1-1.5 cups)*.

Turn onto well-floured counter top. Knead for 3 minutes, adding flower as needed to prevent sticking *(about 3 cups total)*.
Dough should be smooth and soft, but not stickey.

Loosely cover and let rise until double in size, about **45 minutes**.

###Cooking

Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat.

Gently flatten dough and cut into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball.

One ball at a time, roll it out to 6+ inches in diameter. *The thinner the better.*

Spray skillet with nonstick cooking spray, place rolled out dough on skillet and cook until large bubbles form and bottom
side is golden brown. Flip and cook until other side is golden brown as well.

Serve plain, brushed with melted butter, or sprinkled with herbs.
