#Cauliflower Pizza Dough

##Ingredients

* 1 head of cauliflower (we used a medium sized one and it was more than enough)
* 1 egg
* A dollop of goat cheese
* 1/2 cup grated parm (or more!)
* Salt, pepper, and any other seasoning or herb you want in the dough
* Garlic or garlic powder

###Suggested Toppings

* Fresh mozzarella
* Sliced tomatoes (or tomato sauce)
* Basil
* More parm, to sprinkle on top

##Instructions

Grind up the cauliflower in your food processor.

Cook the cauliflower in microwave for 5 minutes.

After it cools place it into a piece of cheesecloth and wring **every last drop** of water out of it.

Mix Cauliflower flour with one egg, a dollop of goat cheese, a half a cup or so of grated parm, and any seasoning you want.

Form into crust.

Bake on parchment lined sheet **without toppings** at 425ÂºF for about 10 minutes (until it starts to get golden).

Remove dough from the oven and add toppings

Return to oven, cook for another 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted.

Remove from oven and let cool for a couple of minutes before slicing.
