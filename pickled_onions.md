# Quick Pickled Red Onions

## Ingredients

* 1 Medium red onion
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3/4 c Vinegar (rice, white, apple cider)
* 1 Clove garlic crushed
* 5 Black peppercorns
* 5 Allspice Berries
* 3 Springs thyme
* 1 Red chili

## Instructions

1. Start 2 or 3 cups water boiling in a kettle.
2. Peel and slice onion into quarter inch slices.
3. Par-blanche the onions. Put them in a sieve in the sink and pour boiling water over them.
4. Mix all the other stuff in a jar, add onions, stir & shake. 
5. Refrigerate  for 30 min, several hours best, up to a few weeks. 

## Notes

I often microwave the jar full of stuff to get the salt and sugar dissolved.

Put in whatever spices you want. Sichuan peppercorns, Thai chilis, cloves, anise? Whatever!

Making tacos? Put some jalapenos into rings and put them in there to pickle to.
