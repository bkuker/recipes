# Sicilian Pizza
## Dough

* In Food Processor
  * 500g Bread Flour
  * 14g Kosher Salt
* In Measuring Cup
  * 325g Warm Water
  * 20g Olive Oil
  * 6g (1.5 tsp) yeast

Combine flour & salt in bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade or dough blade attachment.

Add yeast, 20g olive oil, and water.

Process until a dough that rides around the blade forms, then continue processing for 30 seconds.

Pour remaining 40g olive oil into a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet and spread over entire inner
surface with your hands. Transfer dough to baking sheet and turn in oil until thoroughly coated. Spread
gently with your hands. (It will not stretch to fill the pan; this is fine.) Cover baking sheet with
plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature until dough has slackened and started to spread out
toward the edges of the pan, 2 to 3 hours.

Carefully remove plastic wrap from pizza dough. Using oiled hands, and working as gently as possible to
maintain air bubbles, push and stretch dough into the corners of the pan by pressing out from the center,
lifting each corner, and stretching it beyond the edge of the pan. It should pull back until pan is just
filled with dough.

## Pizza

* Sauce
* Sliced Mozz
* Sliced pepperoni
* Grated Ramano Cheese

Thirty minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C).

To Assemble and Bake: Shingle slices of mozzarella cheese evenly over surface of pizza. Spoon sauce on
top of cheese and spread with the back of a spoon. (You will not need all the sauce; use as much as you 
like, but be sparing.) Spread pepperoni slices evenly over surface. Sprinkle with half of Romano cheese.

Bake until done (like 15-20 in our oven, don't be afraid to bake it real good).

Sprinkle with remaining half of Romano cheese, use a pizza wheel to cut it into slices, and serve immediately.
